# What is a Software Template?

A software template is like the blueprint for a project—it gives you a pre-made setup that includes folders, basic code, and instructions. Think of it like the foundation of a house—you don’t have to start from scratch every time. Templates are especially useful in research, where reproducibility and organization are key.
