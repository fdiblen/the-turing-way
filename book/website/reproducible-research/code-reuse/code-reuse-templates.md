# What is a Software Template?

A software template is like the blueprint for a project—it gives you a pre-made setup that includes folders, basic code, and instructions. Templates are especially useful in research, where reproducibility and organization are key.

## Why Use Software Templates?

Software templates are like shortcuts for starting and managing projects. For researchers who work with software, templates make your code easier to understand, share, and reproduce. In this chapter, we’ll dive into how templates work, why they’re useful, and how they can save you time and effort.

> **Personal Note:** *I used to spend hours setting up projects until I discovered the [**NLeSC Python Template**](https://github.com/NLeSC/python-template). It was a game-changer! Suddenly, I could focus on the actual research instead of figuring out where to put files.*

## Why Are Software Templates Useful?

### 1. **They Keep Projects Organized**
Imagine opening an old project and feeling completely lost. Where did you save the scripts? Which folder had the data? Templates fix this by giving every project a predictable structure. For example, you might always have folders named `src` for code, `tests` for testing, and `docs` for documentation. It’s like giving your future self a map.

### 2. **They Teach Good Practices**
Templates are often built by experts and include best practices by default—like clean code, proper documentation, and even FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). Following these practices makes your work more polished and easier for others to use.

> *"In one of the energy research projects at the Netherlands eScience Center, we neededed to share our analysis pipeline with collaborators across different institutions. By using the [**Julia Besties**](https://github.com/JuliaBesties) template, we ensured that all metadata, dependencies, and documentation were in place. This not only streamlined the collaboration but also allowed our team to publish the pipeline in a repository where others could reuse it effortlessly. It was rewarding to see our work cited and adapted by another research group within months of publication."*

### 3. **They Make It Easy to Join a Project**

### 4. **They Make Research Reproducible**

### 5. **They Save Time**

### 6. **They Work Well with Tools**
