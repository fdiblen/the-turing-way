# What is a Software Template?

A software template is like the blueprint for a project—it gives you a pre-made setup that includes folders, basic code, and instructions. Templates are especially useful in research, where reproducibility and organization are key.

## Why Use Software Templates?

Software templates are like shortcuts for starting and managing projects. For researchers who work with software, templates make your code easier to understand, share, and reproduce. In this chapter, we’ll dive into how templates work, why they’re useful, and how they can save you time and effort.

> **Personal Note:** *I used to spend hours setting up projects until I discovered the [**NLeSC Python Template**](https://github.com/NLeSC/python-template). It was a game-changer! Suddenly, I could focus on the actual research instead of figuring out where to put files.*
